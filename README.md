Created a landing page for the Odin Project

Copied the existing template site as close as possible

Things I learned:
1. Certain Elements have default paddings and margins, so you have to factor that in
2. Certain elements would poke through others and you can fix that by adjusting paddings and margin
3. Use margins to push an object aways while padding increases the size of the element
4. Practiced Flexbox properties to position elements where you want them
5. Realized there were VS Code shortcuts that improved productivity greatly such as if you wanted to create a div with a class you can just type div.class instead of the whole tag
